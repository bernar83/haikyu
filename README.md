A volleyball trendline application.  

Using stats while in a match can be a tricky thing. Everyone has personal preferences as to what they want to see in the heat of the moment. Most coaches want the full box score and rotational stats after the match, but they are of little value (for the most part) during the progress of a match. Coaches just need an overall feel for the game, and not to be overloaded with numbers and percentages. That's where the trendline method comes in but instead of using pen and paper, this web app was made.

## Set up dev environment
1. Use `npm install`  to install dependencies in root directory.
2. Use `npm run start` to run server.
3. Win that volleyball game.
